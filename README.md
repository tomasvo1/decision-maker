# Decision maker

This decision maker was made using React, Typescript, SASS, mui v5 and Vite.

## Running it locally

To run it locally, follow these steps:
* run `npm i`
* run `npm run dev` 

## How does it work

This decision maker works by creating attributes (you have to assign name and weight of the attribute) and options (you have to assign name and scores of each attribute you created).

Once you create your first attribute, you will be able to create your first option.

The winner of this decision quest will be determined on the total score of the option. It is calculated by multiplying attribute's score and attribute's weight and then adding it to the accumulated sum of the option.
